# sveltekit-the-learn-showcase

This is a showcase site that I created while taking a course on SvelteKit. It's purpose is to get SvelteKit's features working together as a realistic, online site at Vercel. It is fully responsive, and has server-side functions that read/write to a MongoDB database with env variables. This would be a good starter site to create a SvelteKit website.
